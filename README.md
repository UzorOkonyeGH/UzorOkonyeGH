**Introducing Richard Uzor:**

*Welcome to my GitHub page!*


I am Richard Uzor, a seasoned IT professional with over 8 years of experience, including 3 years specializing in the ServiceNow platform. 
As a dedicated *ServiceNow Administrator*, I have honed my skills in *ITSM process implementation*, covering all stages from *requirement gathering and analysis to design, 
development, testing, and maintenance migration*. 
My expertise extends to *configuring ITSM applications* and setting up *LDAP servers* to integrate user and group data from Active Directory.
I possess a strong understanding of the *software development lifecycle (SDLC)* and project management principles, 
with a proven track record in delivering comprehensive ITSM solutions using ServiceNow.
My knowledge spans *CMDB and IT Asset Management (ITAM)* services, and I am adept at *troubleshooting, applying security policies*, and ensuring compliance with industry 
standards. 
Certified as an ITILv4 and ServiceNow Professional (CSA), I leverage my skills to drive system efficiency, enhance user satisfaction, and maintain data accuracy.



In addition to my ServiceNow expertise, I hold an MBA from Huddersfield Business School and am well-versed in Data Analysis and Agile Methodology. My analytical skills are 
supported by proficiency in data modeling, data mining, data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, utilizing tools such as Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python to
